@Component
public class Application {

    private Application1 application1;

    public Application(Application1 application1) {
        this.application1 = application1;
    }
}

// what it means spring will create the instance behind the scene will manage the dependencies
of which Application1 is required as a dependency of constructor injection and will try to autowire
it

Spring will manage all this manual object creation instances after application context created successfully
which by the way stores bean and dependencies throughout the application

Bean - it is like an instance that spring will create when it sees @Component and its friends like
@Repository, @Service and so on
